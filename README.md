This custom integration surfaces the **Enphase IQ EV Charger 2** in Home Assistant using the same **Enlighten cloud** endpoints used by the Enphase mobile app and adds:

- Start/stop charging directly from Home Assistant
- Set and persist the charger’s current limit (6-40 A)
- View plugged-in, charging, and fault status in real time
- Track live power, session energy, session duration, and daily energy totals
- Inspect connection diagnostics including active interface, IP address, and reporting interval

## Installation

Recommended: HACS
1. In Home Assistant, open **HACS → Integrations**.
2. Click the three‑dot menu → **Custom repositories**.
3. Add `https://github.com/barneyonline/ha-enphase-ev-charger` with category **Integration**.
4. In HACS, search for and open **Enphase EV Charger 2 (Cloud)**, then click **Download/Install**.
5. Restart Home Assistant.
6. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration → Enphase EV Charger 2 (Cloud)** and follow the prompts.

Alternative: Manual copy
1. Copy the `custom_components/enphase_ev/` folder into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Add the integration via **Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration → Enphase EV Charger 2 (Cloud)**.

## Authentication

**Preferred: Sign in with Enlighten credentials**

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration** and pick **Enphase EV Charger 2 (Cloud)**.
2. Enter the Enlighten email address and password that you use at https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/.
3. (Optional) Enable **Remember password** if you want Home Assistant to re-use it for future re-authentications.
4. After login, select your site and tick the chargers you want to add, then finish the flow.

If the login form reports that multi-factor authentication is required, complete the challenge in a browser and retry once the account is verified. Manual header capture is no longer supported.

## Entities & Services

| Entity Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Site sensor | Last Successful Update timestamp and Cloud Latency in milliseconds. |
| Site binary sensor | Cloud Reachable indicator (on/off). |
| Switch | Per-charger charging control (on/off). |
| Button | Start Charging and Stop Charging actions for each charger. |
| Select | Charge Mode selector (Manual, Scheduled, Green) backed by the cloud scheduler. |
| Number | Charging Amps setpoint (6-40 A) without initiating a session. |
| Sensor (charging metrics) | Power, Session Energy, Session Duration, Set Amps, Min/Max Amps, Charge Mode, Phase Mode, and Status. |
| Sensor (diagnostics) | Connector Status, Dynamic Load Balancing status, Connection interface, IP Address, and Reporting Interval sourced from the cloud API. |

**Services (Actions)**

| Action | Description | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enphase_ev.start_charging` | Start charging for the charger(s) selected via the service target; supports multiple devices. | Advanced fields: `charging_level` (optional A, 6–40), `connector_id` (optional; defaults to 1) |
| `enphase_ev.stop_charging` | Stop charging on the charger(s) selected via the service target. | None |
| `enphase_ev.trigger_message` | Request the selected charger(s) to send an OCPP message and return the cloud response. | `requested_message` (required; e.g. `MeterValues`). Advanced: `site_id` (optional override) |
| `enphase_ev.clear_reauth_issue` | Clear the integration’s reauthentication repair for the chosen site device(s). | `site_id` (optional override) |
| `enphase_ev.start_live_stream` | Request faster cloud status updates for a short period. | None |
| `enphase_ev.stop_live_stream` | Stop the cloud live stream request. | None |

## Privacy & Rate Limits

- Credentials are stored in HA’s config entries and redacted from diagnostics.
- The integration polls `/status` every 30 seconds by default (configurable).  
- Uses the Enlighten login flow to obtain session headers and refreshes them automatically when the password is stored.

## Future Local Path

> ⚠️ Local-only access to EV endpoints is **role-gated** on IQ Gateway firmware 7.6.175. The charger surfaces locally under `/ivp/pdm/*` or `/ivp/peb/*` only with **installer** scope. This integration therefore uses the **cloud API** until owner-scope local endpoints are available.

When Enphase exposes owner-scope EV endpoints locally, we can add a local client and prefer it automatically. For now, local `/ivp/pdm/*` and `/ivp/peb/*` returned 401 in discovery.

---

### Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized**: Open the integration options and choose **Start reauthentication** to refresh credentials.  
- **No entities**: Check that your serial is present in `/status` response (`evChargerData`), and matches the configured serial.  
- **Rate limiting**: Increase `scan_interval` to 30s or more.

### Development

- Python 3.13 recommended. Create and activate: `python3.13 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install dev deps: `pip install -U pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-homeassistant-custom-component homeassistant ruff black`
- Lint: `ruff check .`
- Format: `black custom_components/enphase_ev`
- Run tests: `pytest -q`

### Options

- Polling intervals: Configure slow (idle) and fast (charging) intervals. The integration auto‑switches and also uses a short fast window after Start/Stop to reflect changes faster.
- API timeout: Default 15s (Options → API timeout).
- Nominal voltage: Default 240 V; used to estimate power from amps when the API omits power.
 - Fast while streaming: On by default; prefers faster polling while an explicit cloud live stream is active.

### System Health & Diagnostics

- System Health (Settings → System → Repairs → System Health):
  - Site ID: your configured site identifier
  - Can reach server: live reachability to Enlighten cloud
  - Last successful update: timestamp of most recent poll
  - Cloud latency: round‑trip time for the last status request
- Diagnostics: Downloaded JSON excludes sensitive headers (`e-auth-token`, `Cookie`) and other secrets.

### Energy Dashboard

- Use the `Lifetime Energy` sensor for the Energy Dashboard.
  - Go to Settings → Dashboards → Energy → Add consumption.
  - Select `sensor.<charger>_lifetime_energy` (device class energy, state_class total_increasing).
- This tracks the charger’s lifetime kWh reported by Enlighten.

### Behavior notes

- Charging Amps (number) stores your desired setpoint but does not start charging. The Start button, Charging switch, or start service will use that stored setpoint (default 32 A).
- Start/Stop actions treat benign 4xx responses (e.g., unplugged/not active) as no‑ops to avoid errors in HA.
- The Charge Mode select works with the scheduler API and reflects the service’s active mode.

### Reconfigure

- You can reconfigure the integration (switch sites, update charger selection, or refresh credentials) without removing it.
- Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Integrations → Enphase EV Charger 2 (Cloud) → Reconfigure, then sign in with your Enlighten credentials.
- Stored passwords pre-fill automatically; otherwise you will be asked to provide them during the flow.

### Supported devices

- Supported
  - Enphase IQ EV Charger 2 variants (single-connector), as exposed via Enlighten cloud.
- Unsupported / not tested
  - Earlier charger generations or models not exposed by the Enlighten EV endpoints.
  - Multi-connector or region-specific variants not returning compatible status/summary payloads.

### Removing the integration

- Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Integrations.
- Locate “Enphase EV Charger 2 (Cloud)” and choose “Delete” to remove the integration and its devices.
- If installed via HACS, you may also remove the repository entry from HACS after removal.
